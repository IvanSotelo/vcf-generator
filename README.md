## Install

`npm i -D vcf-generator`

## Usage

- Tweak `numOfContactsToGenerate` in `dummy-contacts.js` (and the template according to the vCard v3.0 spec if you'd like)
- `npm run generate`
- Drag `dummy-contacts.vcf` onto your iOS Simulator

No idea how to delete them in iOS Simulator. Please open an issue and let me know.
